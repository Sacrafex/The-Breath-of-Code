# The-Breath-of-Code

**The Breath of Code** is an experimental simulation where **you** ‚Äî the user ‚Äî take the role of God.  
You shape the world. Set the rules. Define the limits.

Inside that world, multiple intelligent entities awaken.  
They wander. They observe. They act and react to the logic you‚Äôve written into creation.

> _If you built a universe‚Ä¶ would its inhabitants believe in you?_

This project merges artificial intelligence, moral systems, procedural generation, and philosophical design to explore the essence of divine influence ‚Äî and the struggle of the created to understand the Creator.

## About the Project

The Breath of Code simulates a universe with many semi-aware entities. Each one follows its own logic, makes decisions, explores, and occasionally... questions things.

You‚Äôre not there physically. You act through changes in the code, rules, terrain, and systems ‚Äî sometimes noticed, sometimes not. Whether you intervene or remain silent, the world continues.

Key mechanics:

- Autonomous entities with thought processes and internal logs
- A mutable environment that responds to divine edits
- World logic that can be moral, chaotic, or indifferent
- Optional visibility of "divine intervention" to the entities

## Creator Requirements

Help us build the world they live in:

**Texture Designers**
- All **block textures** must be `64x64` pixels (`.png`, seamless).
- Transparent backgrounds where necessary.
- Use naming format: `blockname_variant.png` (e.g., `crystal_dark.png`)

**Programmers**
- Do not change the meaning of the game
- Do not source anything outside of this project and implement it

## To-Do (For Contributors)

- Create base textures (grass, stone, sky, water, etc.)
- Improve Styling of Map and Basic HTML Layout
- Improve Controls for Zooming in and out, Panning, etc...
- Implement pathfinding for multiple entities
- Design basic AI thoughts & memory system
- World generator (With Custom Terrain for differnt things)
- Reactions to user-made terrain changes by AI
- Define "intervention events" (e.g., plagues, blessings, revelations)
- Logging system that lets users read what entities are thinking (Mechanic needed for this)
