# The-Breath-of-Code
The Breath of Code is an experimental simulation that attempts to model the attributes and behavior of a divine creator. Blending artificial intelligence, philosophical frameworks, and system logic, the project explores what it means to be "God" in a digital universe.  If God were a program, what would He do?
